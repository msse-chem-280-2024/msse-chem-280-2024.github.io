# Meet your group

To start today's class you will be meeting with your team and 
collaborating with your team on a group repository.

Before beginning this assignment, take some time to come up with a name for your group.

Next, click the following link to start your group repository.
The first person who clicks the link will enter your group name.
Other members will be able to choose the team once it exists.

Start your group repository, [click this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/E_XD54zg).

To start, someone in the group should add a **branch protection rule** to the repository. 
This is available in the "Branches" section in the "Settings" tab for the repository. 
Enable branch protection, then type "main" (for "main" branch) as the "branch name pattern".
Click "require a pull request before merging" in the next section and save.

For today, you should interview and create a markdown file that has information about someone else on your team. Some questions you might think about…

- Where is your team member from?
- Where do they live?
- What is your favorite food? What is your least favorite food?
- What is one thing the two of you have in common (that isn’t the MSSE program)?
- Why did they choose the MSSE degree?

Be creative with your questions, these are only suggestions.
You will need to clone this repository to your local computer.
Then, create a file in the `group_bios` folder that contains an interview of your group member (save the file with `theirLastName_theirFirstName.md`) and submit a pull request. Be sure to include your name as the author!
