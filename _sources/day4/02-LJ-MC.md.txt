Continue from the notebook you created in the previous lesson.

Recall that our objective is to write a Monte Carlo simulation which we can use to estimate properties of a chemical system. Previously, we used MC integration to evaluate the area of the unit circle. 

We learned that thermodynamic properties can be thought of as very high dimensional integrals. 

$$ \left<Q\right> = \int_V Q\left(\textbf{r}^N\right)
	\rho\left(\textbf{r}^N\right) d\textbf{r}^N
	\label{eq.statMechAverage} $$ 

where $Q\left(\textbf{r}^N\right)$ is the thermodynamic quantity of interest that depends on only on the configuration, $\rho\left(\textbf{r}^N\right) $ is the probability density, and $V$ defines the volume of configuration space over which $\rho$ has support.

Notice here that unlike our integral yesterday, we have a probability density present in the integral. This depends on the conditions of your system (we will use constant volume, constant temperature). This probability density usually depends on temperature. 

In our case, the thermodynamic quantity of interest, $Q$, was the system potential energy. We used the Lennard Jones equation to build a model of a thermodynamic property (potential energy) of a system of particles. 

It is now our task to generate sample configurations of the system. As a consequence, we will be able to measure structural properties of the atoms. 

## Writing the Monte Carlo Loop

Just like with our first Monte Carlo examples, we will be relying on random numbers to sample our configuration space. This translates into generating possible coordinates for our system. However, due to because our high dimensional integral is dominated by a relatively small region of configurational space, it would be very inefficient just pick random numbers for all of our particles. To overcome this problem, we will use the ideas of **importance sampling**.

### Importance Sampling

A solution to this problem is to sample positions from the desired equilibrium probability density. This will generate relevant configurations more frequently than configurations that have low probability. This idea is known as **importance sampling**.

A uniform probability density would means that all values are equally likely. Since our system has so many possible system configurations and many of them are not likely to occur, we do not want to waste time/computational resources on those configurations. We will sample positions from the desired equilibrium probability density $\rho\left(\textbf{r}^N\right)$. 

### Acceptance Criteria

Now that we know our goal, how will we generate atomic positions which are distributed according to $\rho\left(\textbf{r}^N\right)$. 

We are gong to use the *Metropolis-Hasting* algorithm for accepting configurations. The *Metropolis-Hasting* acceptance criteria was first proposed in 1953 by Nicholas Metropolis, and expanded in 1970 by W.K. Hasting.  For our system, the probability that we will accept a change of coordinates is expressed with the following equation:

$$ P_{acc}(m \rightarrow n) = \text{min} \left[
		1,e^{-\beta \Delta U}
	\right] $$

Here, $ \beta $ is equal to $ 1/ T $ ($T$ is temperature).

Practically, the way this works is that we will start with atoms in some configuration. We calculate the potential energy of that configuration. Then, we make a change in coordinates. If the system is at lower energy, we accept this move as a new configuration. If the system is at a higher energy, we accept or reject that configuration based on comparing $e^{-\beta \Delta U}$ and a random number. 

This is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, meaning that acceptance of a random configuration depends on the system's previous configuration. This is in contrast to our calculation of $\pi$ where all points were independent of one another.

### Flow of Calculations

The workflow for a implementing an MC simulation is shown in the image and summarized below

```{image} ../fig/mc_gif2.gif
:align: center
```

1. Generate an initial system state $m$.
2. Choose an atom with uniform probability from $\{1, \ldots, N\}$ from old state $m$.
3. Propose a new state $n$ by translating a LJ particle by a uniform random displacement $\Delta r \sim U(-\Delta x, +\Delta x)$ in each dimension.
	- The displacement scale $\Delta x$ should not be too large as this would
	likely result in particle overlaps, but should not be too small
	as this would result in a slow sampling of configurational space.
4. The difference in energy between the new and old states is computed.
5. The new state is accepted or rejected using the Metropolis criterion.Practically, this can be implemented as follows. 
	- If a move from $m$ to $n$ is "downhill", $\beta \Delta U \leq 0$,
	the move is always accepted. For "uphill" moves, a random number $\zeta$ is generated uniformly on (0,1).  
	- If $\zeta < \exp[-\beta {\Delta U}]$, the move is accepted.  Otherwise, the move is rejected.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
def accept_or_reject(delta_e, beta):
    if delta_e <= 0.0:
        accept = True
    else:
        random_number = random.random()
        p_acc = math.exp(-beta*delta_e)
        if random_number < p_acc:
            accept = True
        else:
            accept = False

    return accept
```
````


### Sanity check

Let's do some of our normal sanity checks. We can think of a few things that should be true for this function:

1. `True` should be returned for a negative `delta_e`
2. `True` should be returned for `delta_e == 0`

For simplicity, we'll use a beta value of 1 for these two tests:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
delta_energy = -1
beta = 1
assert accept_or_reject(delta_energy, beta) is True

delta_energy = 0
beta = 1
assert accept_or_reject(delta_energy, beta) is True
```
````


#### Random Numbers
For `delta_e`> 0 the function relies on a random number generator. This might seem like it would make the function impossible to test since we never know what numbers we will get. However, we can cause our random function to generate the same set of values every time by using something called a random number seed. A random seed is the starting point in generating random numbers.

Let's try setting our random seed to 0:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
random.seed(0)
```
````


Next, generate a random number:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
random.random()
```
````


````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} output
0.8444218515250481
```
````


Everyone should see the same output for this. Rerun your random number generator again, and you should see `0.7579544029403025`.

Set your random number seed to a different number:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
random.seed(5)
random.random()
```
````


````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} output
0.6229016948897019
```
````


Now, reset your seed to 0:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
random.seed(0)
random.random()
```
````


````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} output
0.8444218515250481
```
````


You will notice that this is the same random number you got before when you set the seed to 0. Setting a random number seed means that when that seed is set, you will always get the same sequence of random numbers. We will use this for the sanity check of our function.

For writing our test cases, we will use a reduced temperature of `1`, or a `beta` value of `1`. We need to set the seed before this test to a value that would cause our criteria to return True. Our acceptance criteria is that the random number we generate has to be less than our probability of acceptance. For $1/\beta = 1$ and $\Delta U = 1$, our expression is $e^{-1}$, or a roughly a 37% chance of the move being accepted. Our random number must be less than this in order for our function to return True.

We already know that when we set the random number seed to zero, our first value will be higher than this. If our function behaves correctly, the function should return `False` after we set the seed to 0.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
random.seed(0)
delta_e = 1
beta = 1
assert accept_or_reject(delta_e, beta) is False
```
````


Next, we should find a random seed that returns less than 0.37. Through trial and error, we discover that setting the random seed to be 1 will work:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
random.seed(1)
delta_e = 1
beta = 1
assert accept_or_reject(delta_e, beta) is True
```
````


After we've done these checks, it is a good idea to unset the random seed so that our numbers are random again:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
random.seed()
```
````


## Energy Calculation

In our Monte Carlo loop, we will be calculating the change in energy from a particle movement to decide whether to accept or reject that movement. Previously, we calculated the total pairwise energy for particles. However, when we move a particle, we only need to calculate the energy change for that one particle. We will write a new function for calculating the pairwise interaction energy of a single particle.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
def calculate_pair_energy(coordinates, i_particle, box_length, cutoff):
    """
    Calculate the interaction energy of a particle with its environment (all other particles in the system)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : list
        The coordinates for all particles in the system
        
    i_particle : int
        The particle number for which to calculate the energy
        
    cutoff : float
        The simulation cutoff. Beyond this distance, interactions are not calculated.
    
    Returns
    -------
    e_total : float 
        The pairwise interaction energy of he i_th particle with all other particles in the system.
    """
    
    e_total = 0.0
    i_position = coordinates[i_particle]
 
    num_atoms = len(coordinates)

    for j_particle in range(num_atoms):
        if i_particle != j_particle:

            j_position = coordinates[j_particle]
            rij = calculate_distance(i_position, j_position, box_length)

            if rij < cutoff:
                e_pair = calculate_LJ(rij)
                e_total += e_pair

    return e_total
```
````


### Sanity Checks

We'll use the same system of three particles to check this function.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
coordinates = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2**(1/6)], [0, 0, 2*(2**(1/6))]]

assert calculate_pair_energy(coordinates, 1, 10, 3) == -2

assert calculate_pair_energy(coordinates, 0, 10, 3) == calculate_pair_energy(coordinates, 2, 10, 3)

assert calculate_pair_energy(coordinates, 0, 10, 2) == -1
```
````


## Simulation

Now that we have written the functions we need, we will now write the simulation loop.

We start by defining the simulation parameters. We set the reduced temperature and the number of Monte Carlo steps are going to attempt, as well as the maximum distance we will displace a particle during a Monte Carlo move. We also set a variable here called `freq` which is the frequency we want to print out energy values.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
# Parameters
reduced_temperature = 0.9
num_steps = 5000
max_displacement = 0.1
cutoff = 3.0
freq = 1000

# Calculated quantities
beta = 1 / reduced_temperature
```
````


Next, we must have a system of particles to simulate. We will use the reference system from NIST:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
# Read initial coordinates
coordinates, box_length = read_xyz('sample_config1.xyz')
num_particles = len(coordinates)
```
````


Next, we set our change in energy to 0 and calculate the total energy of the system.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
delta_energy = 0

total_energy = calculate_total_energy(coordinates, box_length, cutoff)
total_energy += calculate_tail_correction(num_particles, box_length, cutoff)
```
````


We have now finished our initial set-up and are ready for our Monte Carlo loop. We will first create our loop and write in comments what we need to do.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python
for step in range(num_steps):
    
    # 1. Randomly pick one of N particles

    # 2. Calculate the interaction energy of the selected particle with the system and store this value.
    
    # 3. Generate random x, y, z displacement

    # 4. Modify coordinate of Nth particle by generated displacements
        
    # 5. Calculate interaction energy of moved particle with the system and store this value.
    
    # 6. Calculate if we accept the move
    
    # 7. if accept, move particle
    
    # 8. print energy if step is multiple of freq
```
````


1. Randomly pick one of N particles.
    For #1 we have to randomly pick one of N particles. This means we need a number on the range of 0 to 800. Take a look at [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) for the `random` module and see if you can find a function for this.

    The function we will use is `rand.randrange`. If we add `num_particles` as an argument, it will pick a number between 0 and `num_particles` (For our NIST file, this would be between 0 and 799).

1. Calculate the interaction energy of the selected particle with the system and store this value.

    We will use our `calculate_pair_energy` function with the random particle index for this.

1. Generate a random x, y, z displacement.
    For #2, we need to generate three random numbers between -max_displacement and max_displacement. By examining the random documentation again, we will find that the function we want to use is `random.uniform`.

1. Modify coordinate of Nth particle by generated displacements.

    We will need to change the position of the particle selected in #1 by the values generated in #2. 

1. Calculate interaction energy of moved particle with the system and store this value.

    We will use our `calculate_pair_energy` function with our updated coordinates and the random particle index for this.

1. Calculate if we accept the move

    Subtract the original system energy from the new system energy, and use the `accept_or_reject` function.

1. If accept is `True`, keep the coordinates, otherwise, rollback to our previous value.

1. Print energy if step is multiple of freq. We will use the modulus (`%`) operator for this. This operator returns the remainder from division.

We'll also add an energies list which we'll append to every time we print the energy. With these considerations, our final MC loop looks like this.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} python

num_steps = 5000
max_displacement = 0.1

num_particles = len(coordinates)

steps = []

    # Generate random x, y, z displacement
    x_rand = random.uniform(-max_displacement, max_displacement)
    y_rand = random.uniform(-max_displacement, max_displacement)
    z_rand = random.uniform(-max_displacement, max_displacement)

    coordinates[random_particle][0] += x_rand
    coordinates[random_particle][1] += y_rand
    coordinates[random_particle][2] += z_rand
    
    proposed_energy = calculate_pair_energy(coordinates, random_particle, box_length, cutoff)
    
    # Calculate change in potential energy for particle move.
    delta_energy = proposed_energy - current_energy

    accept = accept_or_reject(delta_energy, beta)
    
    if accept:
        total_energy += delta_energy
        n_accept += 1
    else:
        # Move is not accepted, roll back coordinates
        coordinates[random_particle][0] -= x_rand
        coordinates[random_particle][1] -= y_rand
        coordinates[random_particle][2] -= z_rand
    
    if step % freq == 0:
        print(step, total_energy/num_particles)
        steps.append(step)
        energies.append(total_energy/num_particles)
```
````


At the end of your MC run, you will have a list of steps, energies, and your coordinates will be updated to the final MC step.
