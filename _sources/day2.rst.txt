Day 2
=====

Overview
--------
Today, we introduce the idea of Monte Carlo methods. We will first use Monte Carlo integration to calculate the value of $\pi$, using a unit circle.
Next, we will start learning about how molecular systems are modeled on a computer. 
An equation called the "Lennard Jones equation" is commonly used to model non-bonded interactions of molecules. 
The Lennard Jones equation will be introduced and discussed today.
