## Library Tutorial

As a graduate student at UC Berkeley, you now have access to amenities such as UC Berkeley's library.
For this class's warm-up, you'll be using the UC Berkeley library to find read "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup.
Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of the C++ programming language and has written many books on the subject.
This book is an introduction to C++.
In Chem 274A, we will also be using another book, "The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup, which is a more advanced book on C++.

To access the textbook, go to the [UC Berkeley Library](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/) website.
Enter the title of the book in the search bar, as shown below and search.

Find the book in the list of results.
You can click the title to open more information, but ultimately to access the book, click "Available Online" and follow links in that section.
You will need to log into your Berkeley account to access the book.

After logging in, you should be able to access the book.
Pick a chapter from the book and read it.
As you read, take note of interesting ideas and points.
These don't have to be directly related to programming syntax.
For example, Dr. Nash finds Stroustrup's observation "Good software is invisible" in Chapter 1 to be particularly interesting (we could have a whole discussion on this one sentence).
You can also take note of any questions you have about the chapter.

After 15-20 minutes, take some time to discuss what you read with your group.
Then, make a note on the class [Google Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13b2208ItU8VLqdxMI1ovSCl0Ll3aIYy6CdWZUZi5LxA/edit?usp=sharing).
