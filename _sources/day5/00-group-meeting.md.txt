# Class Warm Up

Work through our first lesson on NumPy with your group. 
In the class [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bs5K45Y9uPrfE1XoGYgawg4_oA9DGKwAGTD_-KCbe0Y/edit?usp=sharing) 
write at least 10 important points from the lesson for your group.
We will take about 30-45 minutes for this activity.

While in your group, please take the mid-course survey available on BCourses under the Day 5 module.
Also prepare for the day by making sure all pull requests are merged!
