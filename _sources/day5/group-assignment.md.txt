# Group Homework Assignment - Day 5

For your final project, you will need to write a version of your molecular Monte Carlo simulation that uses NumPy.

Today, take time to to discuss with your teammates what changes you can make to your code to take advantage of the features of NumPy arrays. For this portion, take the first 20 minutes to think about this by yourself, then discuss for with your group. We will talk as a class about parts that can be rewritten about an hour into group work time.

For the pull request for today, just submit your lecture notes (including the NumPy tutorial). 
You are free to start working on your NumPy implementation with your group or catch up on other topics for as long as you would like, but you can also leave after the class discussion (mentioned above, will be about one hour into group work time).
Remember that you will have to write a NumPy version of your code, so it might be a good idea to start while you have time.
You might also choose to work on individual homework!

Have a good weekend!
