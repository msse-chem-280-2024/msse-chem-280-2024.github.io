# Day 1 - Group Assignment 

For this homework assignment, you will be collaborating with the rest of the class on a group repository.

Follow the instructions in the [GitHub Collaboration lesson for contributing to a repository](collaboration) using an element you choose. 
Make sure that you claim your element using a GitHub Issue before making your pull request.

## Turning this assignment in
In order to complete this assignment, you must:
1. Complete the exercise linked above with your element of choice, including creating an issue and a pull request.
2. Submit pull request to the central repository.
3. Review a teammate's pull request. When you review, you should leave at least one comment. **Make sure that they have included information about their chosen element, and make sure that they have the proper page header and file name!**
4. Turn your assignments in on bCourses. You will turn in the URL of your pull request and review, so your change does not have to be merged yet to be complete.
5. Have your pull request approved and merged to the main repository (this can happen after you submit your bCourses link)
