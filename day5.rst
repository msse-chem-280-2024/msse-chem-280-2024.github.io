Day 5
=====

Overview
--------
In today's class, we will introduce the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library. 
NumPy is a powerful library that is widely used for numerical applications.
Its main data structure, the NumPy array, allows for multi-dimensional arrays that can take advantage of a property
called "broadcasting".
NumPy is built on C (a compiled language), so can be much faster than standard Python alone.

We then will move our code to a Python module. This will allow us to import our functions into other Python 
files or the Jupyter notebook.
