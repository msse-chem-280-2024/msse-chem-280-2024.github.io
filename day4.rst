Day 4
=====

Overview
--------
Today, we return to Monte Carlo methods. 
In previous days, we learned about simple Monte Carlo integration.
Then, we learned about the Lennard Jones equation, an empirical model that is often used to model the potential energy of 
non-bonded atoms.
Today, we will combine Monte Carlo and the Lennard Jones equation in order to create a molecular Monte Carlo simulation.
Our molecular Monte Carlo simulation will generate configurations of our system, which then can be analyzed to get molecular properties.
Because MC simulation of a molecular system is more complicated than our original Monte Carlo problem (one dimensional integration of a function),
we will have to change some of the ways our MC is performed.
